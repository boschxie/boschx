          <p>Had quick lunch at NCS hub canteen and tried their nasi goreng with loder. Not too bad, as the gravy went well with the rice, but was a bit disappointed that it was not coconut rice otherwise it would have gotten a higher score. The vegetables were quite fresh and the sambal was good.</p>

          <p>Tried out the birthday offer by DBS for 50% discount for 2nd paying customer. The afternoon high tea was inspired by British food, and had various items such as scotch eggs, beef sliders, mash potato etc. The combination was good and it came with free flow of coffee/tea and 1 pint of beer. Nice for Friday afternoon.</p>
